# Combining evolutionary and geographic information
In order to examine geographic distributions of species, it is useful to tie together information about phylogenetic relationships, which we can get from Open Tree of Life, with information about where individuals of that species are found.

```{r}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(rgbif)
library(rotl)
library(phytools)
```


# Choose some species
Lets look for some fun species, 
A polar bear, "Ursus maritimus", a hippo "Hippopotamus amphibius", a gorilla "Gorilla gorilla" and a wild boar "Sus scrofa".

```{r}
polarbear <-"Ursus maritimus"
hippo <-"Hippopotamus amphibius"
boar <-"Sus scrofa"
gorilla <- "Gorilla gorilla"
spp <- c(polarbear, boar, gorilla, hippo)
```

We can use Open Tree of Life to generate a tree for our species!  
![](OpenTree-final-logo-copy.png)
```{r}
taxa <- tnrs_match_names(spp, context="Animals")
tr <- tol_induced_subtree(ott_id(taxa), label="name")
plot(tr)
```

# Don't forget to cite the studies that went into building your tree!
Pulling supporting studies isn't included in rotl yet (or I couldn't find it).
So we will use an Open Tree API call directly.

```{r}
url_ot <- 'https://api.opentreeoflife.org/v3/tree_of_life/induced_subtree'
body <- list(ott_ids=taxa$ott_id)
r <- POST(url_ot, body = body, encode = "json")#gets which studies support the subtree from  the open tree API
for(study in content(r)$supporting_studies){
meta <- get_study_meta(study) #pulls the metadata for each study
pub <- get_publication(meta)  #grabs teh publication information
cat(pub,"\n\n")
}
```
# Lets combine the phylogenetic information from Open Tree with geographic information from GBIF


We will use the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to search for records of these species, and arbitrarily chose the first record returned as the location for the species. (sometimes the first record has no lat-long info, and we need to find a better one)

```{r}
dat1 <- occ_search(scientificName = polarbear, fields=c('name','decimalLatitude', 'decimalLongitude'), limit = 1)
dat2 <- occ_search(scientificName =hippo, fields=c('name','decimalLatitude', 'decimalLongitude'), limit = 1)
dat3 <- occ_search(scientificName = boar,  fields=c('name','decimalLatitude', 'decimalLongitude'), limit = 1)
dat4 <- occ_search(scientificName = gorilla, fields=c('name','decimalLatitude', 'decimalLongitude'), limit = 1)
locs <- as.data.frame(rbind(dat1$data,dat2$data, dat3$data, dat4$data)) #Combine the data from each species
rownames(locs) <- locs[,1] # set the rownames to the taxon names
latlong <- as.matrix(locs[,c(3,2)]) #flip the columns to lat, long instead of long,lat
# enforce newick style tip names, by replacing spaces with underscores
rownames(latlong) <- gsub(' ','_',rownames(latlong)) 
```
Check that your species are all included and have the correct names (taxonomic name recognition sometimes updates them)
```{r}
latlong
```

# We can rotate our tree so it will map prettily by sorting the latitudes, and choosing the random tree rotation which is closest to that order
```{r}
nn<-sample(1:tr$Nnode+Ntip(tr),100,replace=TRUE)
for(i in 1:length(nn)) tr<-read.tree(text=write.tree(rotate(tr,nn[i])))

x<-names(sort(latlong[,2]))
sort_tr<-minRotate(tr,x)

```

# Now to join together the geographic information with the phylogenetic information!
Trees from OpenTree don't automatically come with branch lengths - we need to infer some branch lengths for this tree in order to plot it. (in fruture we can use R-Datelife! datelife.org)

```{r}
tr_bl<-compute.brlen(sort_tr)
```

Combine the phylogeny and the mapped locations
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
tdobj<-phylo.to.map(tr_bl,latlong,direction="rightwards")
```
